Analysis of a five card poker hand and winning distributions based on 10,000 hands


Group report based on 10,000 hands. Goal was to find strictly the highest chances of winning based on the cards dealt and which cards to keep. It largely ignores the value of the hand but rather winning against an opponent based on distributions.


Visualization and analytics were all performed using R, however other software was used, such as matlab and java.
